## Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
```bash
# Go to github.com and create a new repository
# Recommended name: "azure-pim-solution"
# Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
```

### 2. Add Remote and Push
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/azure-pim-solution.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Update README Links (Optional)
After pushing, update these links in README.md to point to your actual repository:
- Line 40: `https://github.com/yourusername/azure-pim-solution.git`
- Discussion links
- Issue links

## Testing Tag Application

To test the tagging system:

```powershell
# Run the standalone tag script
cd scripts
.\06-apply-tags.ps1

# Or run the full deployment which includes tags
.\00-quick-deploy.ps1
```

Tags will be visible in Azure Portal under each resource's "Tags" section.
