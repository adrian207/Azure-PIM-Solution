## Main Conclusion

The automated incident response system provides intelligent, risk-based security automation that responds to privileged access incidents in real-time, significantly reducing mean time to response (MTTR) while maintaining appropriate human oversight for critical decisions. By combining automated playbooks and PowerShell scripts with tiered severity-based responses, organizations achieve comprehensive security protection across all risk levels.

---

## Three Key Supporting Ideas

### 1. Intelligent Detection Triggers Immediate Response

**The Challenge:** Security incidents involving privileged access require immediate response to limit damage, but manual investigation and remediation can take hours or days. During this time, attackers may expand their access or exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Our Approach:** Automated detection of security anomalies triggers immediate, appropriate responses based on severity. The system analyzes access patterns, risk scores, and behavioral data to identify suspicious activities and respond within minutes rather than hours.

**Detection Capabilities:**

```yaml
Real-Time Monitoring:
  ├── Anomaly detection from Azure AD logs
  ├── Risk score calculations from AccessEvents
  ├── Behavioral pattern analysis
  ├── Geographic access monitoring
  └── Privilege escalation tracking

Detection Triggers:
  ├── High-risk location access (Score > 8.0)
  ├── Impossible travel detection
  ├── Unusual access patterns (>3x normal frequency)
  ├── Privilege escalation anomalies
  └── Failed authentication spikes
```

### 2. Risk-Based Automation Scales with Severity

**The Strategy:** Different security incidents require different response levels. Critical incidents demand immediate automated action, while high-severity incidents benefit from semi-automated workflow requiring human verification. Medium and low-severity incidents trigger alerts for investigation.

**Tiered Response Framework:**

**Critical Severity (Score 8.0-10.0) - Fully Automated:**
```
Detection → Immediate Auto-Response:
  ├── Automatically revoke all privileged access
  ├── Block account from signing in
  ├── Isolate user session immediately
  ├── Notify security team (multiple channels)
  ├── Create high-priority incident ticket
  └── Log all actions for forensic analysis

Target Response Time: < 2 minutes
Human Approval: None (too urgent)
```

**High Severity (Score 6.0-7.9) - Semi-Automated:**
```
Detection → Recommended Actions:
  ├── Suggest access revocation
  ├── Suggest account blocking
  ├── Alert security team
  ├── Notify user's manager
  ├── Create incident ticket
  └── Request approval for automated action

Security team reviews recommendation within 15 minutes
Can approve for immediate automated response
Target Response Time: < 30 minutes
```

**Medium Severity (Score 4.0-5.9) - Investigate and Alert:**
```
Detection → Investigation Alerts:
  ├── Notify security team
  ├── Create investigation task
  ├── Alert user's manager
  ├── Log suspicious activity
  └── Monitor for escalation

Human investigation required
No automated action (policy violation risk)
Target Response Time: < 4 hours
```

**Low Severity (Score 2.0-3.9) - Monitor and Log:**
```
Detection → Security Monitoring:
  ├── Log event for analysis
  ├── Add to user's risk profile
  ├── Review in next access certification
  └── No immediate action required

Tracked for pattern detection
May aggregate into higher severity
```

### 3. Orchestrated Response Ensures Coordinated Security Actions

**The Integration:** Automated responses don't operate in isolation—they coordinate multiple security actions simultaneously across different systems and notify relevant stakeholders. Each automated action triggers related workflows to ensure complete incident management.

**Response Orchestration:**

**Immediate Actions (Automated):**
```
When Critical Incident Detected:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. Revoke PIM Access (Azure AD)        │
  │  2. Block Account (Conditional Access)  │
  │  3. Force Sign-Out (Azure AD)           │
  │  4. Notify Security Team (Email/SMS)    │
  │  5. Create Incident (ServiceNow/ITSM)   │
  │  6. Alert Manager (Office 365)          │
  │  7. Log to SIEM (Azure Sentinel)        │
  │  8. Update Dashboard (Power BI)         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

All actions complete within 2 minutes
Full audit trail maintained
```

**Investigation Workflow (Semi-Automated):**
```
High-Severity Incident Workflow:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Step 1: Security Analyst Reviews  │ ← Human Input
  │  Step 2: Approve Recommended Action│
  │  Step 3: Execute Automated Response│ ← Automated
  │  Step 4: Generate Investigation    │ ← Automated
  │  Step 5: Stakeholder Notifications │ ← Automated
  │  Step 6: Post-Incident Review      │ ← Scheduled
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How to Build: Automated Incident Response System

This section provides step-by-step instructions to build a complete automated incident response system using both Azure Logic Apps playbooks and PowerShell automation scripts.

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Azure PIM already deployed
- Azure Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace
- Azure Logic Apps (Standard plan or better)
- PowerShell 7.0+
- AnomalyDetector.ps1 from this solution

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours for complete setup

---

### Method 1: Azure Logic Apps Playbook (No-Code Approach - 30 Minutes)

**What You're Building:** Visual workflows that automatically respond to security incidents using drag-and-drop logic.

#### Step 1: Create Logic App and Connect Data Sources

```
Portal Steps:
1. Navigate to: Azure Portal → Logic Apps → Create
2. Configure:
   - Name: "PIM-Incident-Response"
   - Region: Your region
   - Plan Type: Standard
   - Pricing Plan: Standard
3. Click "Create"
4. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
5. Click "Go to resource"
```

#### Step 2: Create Critical Incident Playbook

```
Portal Steps (in Logic Apps Designer):
1. Click "Blank logic app" to start
2. Add Trigger: "Azure Monitor Logs - When Log Analytics Query Returns Results"
3. Configure trigger:
   - Workspace: Select your Log Analytics workspace
   - Query: |
     PIMAuditLog_CL
     | where RiskScore_d >= 8.0
     | where EventType_s == "Access"
     | where TimeGenerated > ago(5m)

                    if ($anomalies.Count -gt 0) {
                        $this.RespondToIncident($anomalies[0])
                    }
                }
                
                Start-Sleep -Seconds 300  # Check every 5 minutes
            } catch {
                Write-Host "Error in monitoring: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
                Start-Sleep -Seconds 60
            }
        }
    }

    [array] GetRecentAccessEvents() {
        # In production, fetch from Azure Monitor Logs
        # For demo, return mock data
        return @()
    }
}

# Export for use
Export-Module sessions -Type IncidentResponder -Function MonitorAccessEvents
```

#### Step 2: Create Monitoring and Response Script

```powershell
# File: scripts/security/Monitor-And-Respond.ps1

Import-Module .\Incident-Response.ps1 -Force

# Initialize responder
$responder = [IncidentResponder]::new()

Write-Host "========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "PIM Automated Incident Response" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host ""

# Start monitoring
$responder.MonitorAccessEvents()
```

### Method 3: Hybrid Approach - Combine Playbooks and PowerShell

**What You're Building:** Combine Logic Apps for orchestration with PowerShell for complex decision logic.

#### Step 1: Use Logic Apps for Orchestration

Create Logic App that calls PowerShell script:
```
Portal Steps:
1. Create Logic App: "PIM-Hybrid-Response"
2. Trigger: Azure Monitor Logs query
3. Add Action: "Run PowerShell Script"
4. Configure:
   - Script: Your Incident-Response.ps1
   - Function: RespondToIncident
   - Parameters: Pass AccessEvent data
5. Add Action: "Send Email" for results
6. Save and enable
```

#### Step 2: PowerShell Handles Complex Logic

The PowerShell script provides:
- Complex risk calculations
- Multi-factor decision making
- Integration with multiple systems
- Detailed logging

#### Step 3: Orchestration Benefits

```
Logic Apps handles:
├── Trigger management (event-driven)
├── Multi-step workflows
├── Human approval workflows
├── Integration with many Azure services
└── Visual monitoring and debugging

PowerShell handles:
├── Complex risk analysis
├── Detailed security operations
├── Custom integrations
├── Advanced logging
└── Programmatic control
```

## Where to Run the PowerShell Scripts

### Deployment Options

You have several options for running the incident response PowerShell scripts. Choose the approach that best fits your environment:

#### Option 1: Azure Automation Runbook (Recommended for Production)

**What It Is:** Managed service in Azure that runs PowerShell scripts on a schedule or in response to events.

**Why Use It:** 
- ✅ Fully managed and highly available
- ✅ No server maintenance required
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Built-in logging and monitoring

**How to Deploy:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Create Automation Account
New-AzAutomationAccount `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "pim-automation" `
    -Location "EastUS" `
    -Plan "Basic"

# Step 2: Upload PowerShell module
New-AzAutomationModule `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "Incident-Response" `
    -ContentLink "https://your-storage-account.blob.core.windows.net/modules/Incident-Response.ps1" `
    -ContentLinkVersion "1.0"

# Step 3: Create runbook
New-AzAutomationRunbook `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "Monitor-PIM-Incidents" `
    -Type PowerShell

# Step 4: Add runbook content
$runbookContent = Get-Content ".\Monitor-And-Respond.ps1" -Raw
Import-AzAutomationRunbook `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "Monitor-PIM-Incidents" `
    -Type PowerShell `
    -Description "Automated PIM incident response" `
    -Force

# Step 5: Publish runbook
Publish-AzAutomationRunbook `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "Monitor-PIM-Incidents"

# Step 6: Create schedule to run every 5 minutes
$schedule = New-AzAutomationSchedule `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -Name "Every-5-Minutes" `
    -StartTime (Get-Date) `
    -DayInterval 1 `
    -DayIntervalInterval 1

Register-AzAutomationScheduledRunbook `
    -AutomationAccountName "pim-automation" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -RunbookName "Monitor-PIM-Incidents" `
    -ScheduleName "Every-5-Minutes"

Write-Host "✅ Runbook deployed and scheduled!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**How It Works:**
```
Azure Automation Service
├── Runs your PowerShell script every 5 minutes
├── Calls Incident-Response.ps1 module
├── Monitors for security incidents
├── Executes automated responses
└── Logs all actions for audit
```

**Portal Steps (Alternative):**
```
1. Azure Portal → Automation Accounts → Create
2. Name: "pim-automation"
3. Create runbook → PowerShell → Monitor-PIM-Incidents
4. Paste your script content
5. Publish → Create schedule → Every 5 minutes
6. Start runbook
```

---

#### Option 2: Windows Scheduled Task (On-Premises)

**What It Is:** Run PowerShell as a scheduled task on a Windows server.

**Why Use It:**
- ✅ Works without Azure services
- ✅ Low cost (use existing server)
- ✅ Full control over execution

**How to Deploy:**

```powershell
# Create scheduled task to run every 5 minutes
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction `
    -Execute "PowerShell.exe" `
    -Argument "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Scripts\PIM\Monitor-And-Respond.ps1" `
    -WorkingDirectory "C:\Scripts\PIM"

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 5) -RepetitionDuration (New-TimeSpan -Days 365) -Once -At (Get-Date)

$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "SYSTEM" -RunLevel "Highest"

$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet `
    -AllowStartIfOnBatteries `
    -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries `
    -StartWhenAvailable

Register-ScheduledTask `
    -TaskName "PIM-Automated-Incident-Response" `
    -Action $action `
    -Trigger $trigger `
    -Principal $principal `
    -Settings $settings `
    -Description "Automated PIM incident response and monitoring"

Write-Host "✅ Scheduled task created and running!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**Server Requirements:**
```
- Windows Server 2016 or later
- PowerShell 7.0+
- Azure AD PowerShell module
- Az PowerShell module
- Internet connectivity
- System service account
```

---

#### Option 3: Azure Function App (Event-Driven)

**What It Is:** Serverless function that triggers on events (logs, alerts, etc.)

**Why Use It:**
- ✅ Event-driven (instant response)
- ✅ No idle costs
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ Integrated with Azure services

**How to Deploy:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Create Function App
New-AzFunctionApp `
    -Name "pim-incident-response" `
    -ResourceGroupName "pim-rg" `
    -PlanName "function-app-plan" `
    -PlanResourceGroup "pim-rg" `
    -StorageAccountName "pimfunctionstorage" `
    -Runtime PowerShell `
    -FunctionsVersion 4

# Step 2: Create function
# Portal Steps:
# 1. Function App → Functions → Create Function
# 2. Template: Azure Monitor Log Trigger
# 3. Name: "RespondToPIMIncidents"
# 4. Paste your response script
# 5. Save and Deploy
```

**Function Trigger Configuration:**

```
Trigger: Azure Monitor Logs Alert
Query: RiskScore_d >= 8.0
Frequency: Real-time

When alert fires:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Function Executes        │
│ ├── Get incident data    │
│ ├── Classify severity    │
│ ├── Execute response     │
│ └── Log all actions      │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Option 4: Azure Logic Apps (No-Code + PowerShell)

**What It Is:** Use Logic Apps to orchestrate and call PowerShell when needed.

**How It Works:**

```
Logic Apps Playbook
    ↓
Calls Azure Automation Runbook
    ↓
Executes PowerShell Response Script
    ↓
Returns Results
    ↓
Logic App continues workflow
```

**Portal Steps:**

```
1. Logic App → Create
2. Trigger: "When Alert Fired" (Azure Monitor)
3. Action: "Run PowerShell Script in Runbook"
4. Configure:
   - Automation Account: pim-automation
   - Runbook: Monitor-PIM-Incidents
5. Action: "Send Email" for results
6. Save and enable
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual workflow designer
- Easy to modify without coding
- Combines PowerShell power with Logic Apps orchestration
- Built-in monitoring and debugging

---

#### Option 5: Continuous Running Background Service

**What It Is:** PowerShell script runs continuously as a background service.

**When to Use:** For on-premises deployment or when you need real-time continuous monitoring.

**How to Deploy:**

```powershell
# Create Windows Service wrapper script
# File: Install-IncidentResponse-Service.ps1

# Install service using NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) or similar
# Download NSSM: https://nssm.cc/download

# Install service
.\nssm.exe install "PIM-Incident-Response" `
    "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" `
    "-File C:\Scripts\PIM\Monitor-And-Respond.ps1"

# Configure service
.\nssm.exe set "PIM-Incident-Response" Description "Automated PIM incident response monitor"
.\nssm.exe set "PIM-Incident-Response" Start SERVICE_AUTO_START
.\nssm.exe set "PIM-Incident-Response" AppStdout "C:\Logs\PIM-Response.log"
.\nssm.exe set "PIM-Incident-Response" AppStderr "C:\Logs\PIM-Response-Error.log"

# Start service
.\nssm.exe start "PIM-Incident-Response"

Write-Host "✅ Service installed and running!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**Service Management:**

```powershell
# Check service status
Get-Service "PIM-Incident-Response"

# Start service
Start-Service "PIM-Incident-Response"

# Stop service
Stop-Service "PIM-Incident-Response"

# View logs
Get-Content "C:\Logs\PIM-Response.log" -Tail 50
```

---

#### Option 6: Manual Testing and Development

**What It Is:** Run PowerShell scripts manually for testing or development.

**When to Use:** For testing, development, or one-time investigations.

**How to Run:**

```powershell
# Method 1: Run in PowerShell Terminal

# Open PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Github\Azure-PIM-Solution\scripts\security

# Run the script
.\Monitor-And-Respond.ps1

# Or run specific functions
Import-Module .\Incident-Response.ps1
$responder = [IncidentResponder]::new()
$responder.MonitorAccessEvents()


# Method 2: VS Code Integrated Terminal

# Open VS Code in project folder
code C:\Github\Azure-PIM-Solution

# Open terminal (Ctrl+`)
# Run script
cd scripts\security
.\Monitor-And-Respond.ps1


# Method 3: Run from Cloud Shell

# Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell mode)
# Upload your scripts first
az storage blob upload --account-name mystorageaccount --container-name scripts --name Monitor-And-Respond.ps1 --file ./Monitor-And-Respond.ps1

# Run in Cloud Shell
./Monitor-And-Respond.ps1
```

## Complete Examples: Real-World Scenarios

### Example 1: Auto-Revoke on Suspicious Location

```powershell
# Scenario: User accesses privileged role from high-risk country
$suspiciousEvent = @{
    UserPrincipalName = "admin@company.com"
    RiskScore = 8.5
    AnomalyType = "Location-Based Anomaly"
    Location = "Russia"  # High-risk country
    Role = "Global Administrator"
    Timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
    PreviousLocations = @("United States")
}

# Trigger response
$responder = [IncidentResponder]::new()
$responder.RespondToIncident($suspiciousEvent)

# Expected Response:
# ✅ Access revoked immediately (Critical)
# ✅ Account blocked
# ✅ Security team notified
# ✅ Incident ticket created
```

### Example 2: Impossible Travel Detection

```powershell
# Scenario: User signs in from impossible location
$travelEvent = @{
    UserPrincipalName = "user@company.com"
    RiskScore = 9.0
    AnomalyType = "Impossible Travel Detected"
    CurrentLocation = "China"
    PreviousLocation = "United States"
    PreviousTimestamp = (Get-Date).AddHours(-2).ToString("o")  # 2 hours ago
    Timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
    Role = "Production Administrator"
}

# Response: Critical (fully automated)
$responder.RespondToIncident($travelEvent)
```

### Example 3: Privilege Escalation Pattern

```powershell
# Scenario: Unusual privilege escalation detected
$escalationEvent = @{
    UserPrincipalName = "developer@company.com"
    RiskScore = 7.2
    AnomalyType = "Privilege Escalation"
    CurrentRole = "Global Administrator"
    PreviousRole = "Developer"
    Timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
}

# Response: High severity (semi-automated)
# Security team receives approval request
$responder.RespondToIncident($escalationEvent)
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Logic App Not Triggering

**Symptoms:**
- No response to high-risk events
- Logic App shows "Enabled" but no runs

**Solution:**
```
1. Check Logic App trigger configuration
2. Verify query returns results:
   Portal → Log Analytics → Run query manually
3. Check workspace permissions
4. Verify trigger is enabled (not disabled)
5. Check execution history for errors
```

### Issue: PowerShell Script Not Responding

**Symptoms:**
- Script running but no actions executed
- No errors in output

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Enable verbose logging
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"

# Check if events are being retrieved
$events = $responder.GetRecentAccessEvents()
Write-Host "Events found: $($events.Count)" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Test detection manually
$testEvent = @{
    UserPrincipalName = "test@company.com"
    RiskScore = 9.0
}
$anomalies = $responder.AnomalyDetector.DetectAnomalies(@($testEvent))
Write-Host "Anomalies detected: $($anomalies.Count)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

### Issue: Automated Actions Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Incidents detected but actions fail
- Error messages in logs

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check Azure AD permissions
Connect-AzureAD
$context = Get-AzContext
Write-Host "Current user: $($context.Account)" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Verify required permissions:
# - User Administrator (for block operations)
# - Global Administrator (for role management)
# - Security Reader (for audit logs)

# Test each action individually
$responder.RevokePIMAccess("test-user@company.com")
$responder.BlockUserAccount("test-user@company.com")
```
