## Three Key Supporting Ideas

### 1. Phased Deployment Minimizes Risk and Ensures Success

**The Challenge:** Implementing a comprehensive PIM solution across an entire organization can be overwhelming if attempted all at once. Large-scale deployments face risks including user disruption, incomplete testing, and organizational resistance.

**Our Approach:** Implement the solution in carefully planned phases, starting with pilot groups and expanding gradually. Each phase includes specific objectives, success criteria, and rollback plans.

**Four-Phase Deployment Strategy:**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue: User cannot activate role**
```
Possible Causes:
├── Role assignment not configured for user
├── MFA requirement not met
├── Justification not provided
├── Conflicting access (separation of duties)
└── System outage or connectivity issue

Resolution Steps:
├── Verify user has eligible role assignment
├── Confirm MFA completed successfully
├── Check for separation of duties conflicts
├── Verify system availability
└── Escalate to PIM administrator if issue persists
```

**Issue: Approver not receiving notifications**
```
Possible Causes:
├── Email address not configured in Azure AD
├── Notification preferences disabled
├── Email filtered as spam
├── Approval delegated to incorrect user
└── Email system outage

Resolution Steps:
├── Verify email address in Azure AD user profile
├── Check notification settings in PIM
├── Review spam/junk folders
├── Verify approval workflow configuration
└── Contact IT for email delivery issues
```

**Issue: Access expired prematurely**
```
Possible Causes:
├── System clock synchronization issue
├── Manual revocation by administrator
├── Policy violation detected
├── Configuration error in duration settings
└── User account deactivated

Resolution Steps:
├── Check PIM audit logs for exact expiration reason
├── Verify system time synchronization
├── Review access duration configuration
├── Check user account status
└── Resubmit access request if appropriate
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and customize the deployment phases based on organizational needs
2. Secure executive sponsorship and stakeholder buy-in
3. Assemble deployment team with required skills
4. Begin Phase 1: Foundation and Pilot deployment
