## Three Key Supporting Ideas

### 1. Phased Deployment Minimizes Risk and Ensures Success

**The Challenge:** Implementing a comprehensive PIM solution across an entire organization can be overwhelming if attempted all at once. Large-scale deployments face risks including user disruption, incomplete testing, and organizational resistance.
