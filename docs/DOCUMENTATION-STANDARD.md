# Documentation Standard Applied

**Date:** December  Milestone  
**Purpose:** All new documentation now follows a consistent, actionable approach

---

## What Changed

All documentation in this project now follows **structured presentation with practical implementation guides**:

### ✅ Before vs. After

**Before (Old Approach):**
- ❌ Conceptual explanations only
- ❌ No build instructions
- ❌ No verification steps
- ❌ Placeholder code
- ❌ Assumed technical knowledge
- ❌ Unstructured presentation

**After (New Standard):**
- ✅ Structured organization (Main Conclusion → Supporting Ideas → Details)
- ✅ Step-by-step build guides
- ✅ Copy-paste ready code
- ✅ Verification scripts included
- ✅ Working examples
- ✅ Beginner-friendly language
- ✅ Logical flow and organization

## New Documentation Standards

Every document must include:

### 1. **How to Build Section** (Required)
- Quick start method (5-30 minutes)
- Full implementation (30-120 minutes)
- Verification script
- Time estimates

### 2. **Working Code Examples** (Required)
- PowerShell scripts with error handling
- Azure Portal step-by-step
- No placeholders or TODOs

### 3. **Verification** (Required)

## How to Apply to New Features

### Step 1: Use the Template

Copy from `docs/CONTRIBUTING-DOCUMENTATION.md`:
```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Overview
[What and why]

## How to Build [Feature]

### Prerequisites
[What's needed]

### Quick Start (X minutes)
[Fast method]

### Full Implementation (X hours)
[Complete method]

## Verification Script
[Test it works]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues]
```

### Step 2: Add Real Code

```powershell
# Copy-paste ready PowerShell
Write-Host "Starting..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Actual working command
$result = Get-AzResourceGroup

if ($result) {
    Write-Host "✅ Success" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
管理者 Write-Host "❌ Failed" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

### Step 3: Test Everything

1. Run all code examples
2. Test verification script
3. Check all links
4. Verify time estimates
5. Get peer review

### Step 4: Include Troubleshooting

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

**Problem: [Common Error]**
```
Solution: [Exact steps]
```
```
